Why the Kadence Theme? 

**Header/Footer Builder** - Unlike other themes, the Kadence Theme comes with a drag and drop header/footer builder. This allows unlimited design possibilities.

**Globally Linked Color Palette** - The color of element on your website is linked to a global color palette. Want to change a color, change it in one place and the color changes across your entire website.

**Globally Linked Fonts** - Like with the color system, the same goes for your font choices. Want to change a font, change it in one place and the font changes across your entire website. 

**WooCommerce Integration** - The Kadence Theme features the most advanced WooCommerce integration to allow you to: customize your WooCommerce product pages, has a flyout cart, cart icon in header, product page bullet points, my account page customizations, and more.

**Nothing Held Back** - Where other free themes stop, the Kadence Theme holds nothing back.
